Overview
========

openprocurement.auctions.dgf contains documentaion for Deposit Guarantee Fund auctions.

There are two procedures:
 
 * dgfOtherAssets - sale of the insolvent bank property.
 
 * dgfFinancialAssets - sale of the creditor claim right.


Features
--------

* No need to specify enquiries period (there is no *active.enquiries* status), since it overlaps with *active.tendering* period.
* Procedure can be switched from *draft* status to *active.tendering*.
* During *active.tendering* period participants can ask questions, submit proposals, and upload documents.
* The only date Organizer has to provide is *Tender.auctionPeriod.startDate*, the rest will be calculated automatically.
* Organizer can edit procedure's significant properties such as *value.amount*, *guarantee.amount* and *minimalStep.amount*, by descreasing these values. The inturn increase is unavailable.
* Properties such as *.currency* and *.valueAddedTaxIncluded* can't be edited. 
* *value.amount* can be reduced per 50% or less for once. The greater reduction is unavailable within the system.
* Such properties as *guarantee.amount* and *minimalStep.amount* are not restricted within percentage descrease.
* There is obligatory participant qualification (*Bid.selfQualified*) via guarantee payment.
* The only currency (*Value.currency*) for this procedure is hryvnia (UAH).
* The items within an auction are allowed to be from different CAV groups.

Conventions
-----------

API accepts `JSON <http://json.org/>`_ or form-encoded content in
requests.  It returns JSON content in all of its responses, including
errors.  Only the UTF-8 character encoding is supported for both requests
and responses.

All API POST and PUT requests expect a top-level object with a single
element in it named `data`.  Successful responses will mirror this format. 
The data element should itself be an object, containing the parameters for
the request.  In the case of creating a new auction, these are the fields we
want to set on the auction itself.

If the request was successful, we will get a response code of `201`
indicating the object was created.  That response will have a data field at
its top level, which will contain complete information on the new auction,
including its ID.

If something went wrong during the request, we'll get a different status
code and the JSON returned will have an `errors` field at the top level
containing a list of problems.  We look at the first one and print out its
message.
